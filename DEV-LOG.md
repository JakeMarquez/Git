## Current Status
V.1.4 - Navigation Bar created in the right margin of the Creation page, allowing users link to the top, bottom, class header, race header, and background header using the JS ScrollIntoView function. Ability Score page styling updated including blinking buttons for Score Swapping, colored tables for easy reading, and an Instructions Modal to to assist new users. Newly created accounts now have a server-side boolean property indicating if they have completed the creation form. When it is false, tool-tips appear on the creation form next to the Instruction's icon that say "Click Me!". Once the creation form has been completed once, the prompts permanantly dissapear.   
V.1.3 - Social Provider Logins added including Google Plus, Twitter, and Microsoft. Facebook was considered but wont allow logins from users who arent administrator's on the application until the application has been released and is reviewed, so it was skipped. Creation page scaffolding was updated to avoid clipping issues. New "Link to Top" button added on the Creation page to help user quickly navigate the document.  
V.1.2 - Dungeon Master page added, Dungeon Master Beta app added, site styling rebuilt with background image, BS panels, Fontawesome icons, Fontawesome Icon animation, New Character form resizing and restyling, New Character form instructions button and modal added, Save Character form resizing and restyling. 

## Known Issues
V.1.4 - While scrolled to the top of the page in the Creation Form, the right-side navbar is invisible, but the links are still active and can be clicked - linking to a different part of the page. This can be troublesome especially if you are a first time user and are drawn to the tooltip that pops up right next to the invisible navbar. The new Ability Score page styling is very untested when it comes to certain races like humans and half-elfs, and the results are varied on scaling. Work arounds will need to be built to handle these scaling exceptions, likewise with the Proficiencies panel directly below it. The Application User Model was updated as well to contain a boolean property defining if a user has completed the Creation Form. this is a extremely unteseted feature, and while is working at the moment, could easily affect other systems on the server side due to the apps reliance on the model.  
V.1.3 - While Social Provider Logins were added, The following register page is unstyled and introduces a inconsistency into the program by registering user's by email - when in fact the website login process is intended to run with usernames to maintain anonymity. User's register with their email and while there is no inherant problem, it will cause issues eventually if not updated to also take a username upon registering this way. [V.1.4 Fixed]  
V.1.2 - Dungeon Master page is in beta, and its only functionality is making creature instances and viewing a short set of details about them. Links on the New Character form stay highlighted when clicked on a mobile device. Selecting a background in the form and then returning the option to blank does not clear the binded model, and the link will still jump you to the previous selection.
