## Current Status
V.1.3 - Social Provider Logins added including Google Plus, Twitter, and Microsoft. Facebook was considered but wont allow logins from users who arent administrator's on the application until the application has been released and is reviewed, so it was skipped. Creation page scaffolding was updated to avoid clipping issues. New "Link to Top" button added on the Creation page to help user quickly navigate the document.  
V.1.2 - Dungeon Master page added, Dungeon Master Beta app added, site styling rebuilt with background image, BS panels, Fontawesome icons, Fontawesome Icon animation, New Character form resizing and restyling, New Character form instructions button and modal added, Save Character form resizing and restyling. 

## Known Issues
V.1.3 - While Social Provider Logins were added, The following register page is unstyled and introduces a inconsistency into the program by registering user's by email - when in fact the website login process is intended to run with usernames to maintain anonymity. User's register with their email and while there is no inherant problem, it will cause issues eventually if not updated to also take a username upon registering this way.   
V.1.2 - Dungeon Master page is in beta, and its only functionality is making creature instances and viewing a short set of details about them. Links on the New Character form stay highlighted when clicked on a mobile device. Selecting a background in the form and then returning the option to blank does not clear the binded model, and the link will still jump you to the previous selection.
