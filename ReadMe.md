## Synopsis

An ongoing project to build a website for DND character creation, and helping Dungeon Masters organize their creatures.

## About
This website utilizes technologies including Angular 1, TypeScript, C#, and .NETcore.

## Motivation

application to help the process go by faster while still showcasing important traits and abilities.

None to date.
